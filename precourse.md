In preparation for the practical sessions, you should install required software on the computer that you will bring to the autumn school.

For this, please follow the steps below:
1. you need write permission to your R library folder (typically `.libPaths()[1]`) and enough free space (>2GB)
2. you need to be connected to the internet 
3. start R-Studio on your computer
4. run the following command on the R console:
  source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NBISweden/single-cell_sib_scilifelab/master/install_packages.R")

The script will check your environment, install what is missing, and report any problems.
During the installation, you may be prompted to update existing packages (recommended).

Donâ€™t worry if not everything is installed successfully - please contact the course organisers for help, either by email or on Sunday before dinner.

We are looking forward to meet you all in Leysin!
