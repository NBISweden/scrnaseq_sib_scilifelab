9288 Mammary epithelial cells from three independent studies:
spk (PumbedID_30089273): 2615 cells
vis (PubmedID_29158510): 3047 cells
wal (PubmedID_29225342): 3626 cells
Each study contains (after cell filtering) cells that are assigned unambiguously to one of three major
mammy epithelial cell types; luminal_pogenitors lumunila mature and basal:

                      spk  vis  wal
  luminal_progenitor 1097  694  729
  basal               475 1257  780
  luminal_mature     1043 1096 2117
